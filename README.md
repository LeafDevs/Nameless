# Leaf's ExpressJS Setup

To get started in your command prompt type `git clone https://github.com/LeafDevs/ExpressJS-Setup.git`

Then create a site in the sites folder and run.

you may need to do `npm i express fs`

# For the competition im submitting this to.

Hello, i hopefully made a start.bat which would install and run everything needed for the website. The only thing you need to make sure is installed is NodeJS 16> and NPM (you might need to install seperately if on linux)

if i didnt make a start.bat file (or .sh if on linux) then you will need to install the node packages i used.

`express` and `fs`



I made this basic setup for expressjs web framework because i was bored so this is just to show off my backend skills.

If this readme.md seems rushed its because im typing this 8 days before submissions are due. and im not fully done with the website.

If i submitted this under 2 names its because I (aaron/leaf) did all the website front end and back end. and Vincent did all the graphic design.
