# Leaf's ExpressJS Setup

To get started in your command prompt type `git clone https://github.com/LeafDevs/ExpressJS-Setup.git`

Then create a site in the sites folder and run.

you may need to do `npm i`

# For the competition im submitting this to.

Hello, i hopefully made a start.bat which would install and run everything needed for the website. The only thing you need to make sure is installed is NodeJS 16> and NPM (you might need to install seperately if on linux)

if i didnt make a start.bat file (or .sh if on linux) then you will need to install the node packages i used using the command `npm install` (make sure you having nodejs installed)

I made this basic setup for expressjs web framework because i was bored so this is just to show off my backend skills.
